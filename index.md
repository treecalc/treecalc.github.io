## What is TreeCalc?

TreeCalc is a programming language with focus on calculations
and business rules. The most important features are:

* easy to learn
* no side effects
* data is part of the program
* organization of computations/rules in trees
* combination of trees into directed acyclic graph
* lists (key/value-pairs) can be attached to inputs
* automatic inference if an input is mandatory
* automatic memoization to boost performance
* translation to Java and JavaScript
* simple API
* JavaScript test calculator
